# Scalable event-driven applications with NestJS (demo)

Join me for a talk on developing scalable event-driven applications with NestJS.

If you’ve never tried NestJS - I’ll talk briefly about its advantages and use cases it can solve for you.

We’ll explore a hands-on example of scalability issues that can happen and the common approaches to solving them.

Thanks and see you.
